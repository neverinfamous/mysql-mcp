# mysql-mcp v2.3.1 Release Notes

**Release Date:** February 18, 2026

Security patch addressing CVE-2026-26960 and hardening the Docker deployment pipeline.

## Security

- **CVE-2026-26960 (tar < 7.5.8)** — Patched npm's bundled `tar` in the Docker runtime image to fix a high-severity path traversal vulnerability that allowed arbitrary file read/write via crafted hardlinks.

## Changed

- **Docker Scout Gate Hardened** — Security scan now **blocks deployments** on any fixable CVE (any severity) using `--only-fixed --exit-code`. Unfixable zero-day CVEs pass through. Previously the scan was informational only.
- **CodeQL Workflow PR Trigger** — Removed `paths` filter from `pull_request` trigger so the required `analyze (javascript-typescript)` check always runs on PRs, preventing non-code PRs from being blocked by branch rulesets.
